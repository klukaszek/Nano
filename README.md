# Nano 0.2

Decided to remove all dependencies on Sokol from Nano. Instead I will try to implement all previous functionality from (basically) scratch. This will be version 0.2. This first commit contains a working demo for a single colour on browser. Still working on porting Compute Shader functionality to my new WebGPU backend.
